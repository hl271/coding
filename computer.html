		<h1>Timeline of Computer History</h1>
		<h2>Bell Laboratories scientist George Stibitz uses relays for a demonstration adder</h2>
		<img src="E:\coding\timeline_computers_1937.modelk" />
		<p>Called the Model K Adder because he built it on his Kitchen table, this simple demonstration circuit provides 
proof of concept for applying Boolean logic to the design of computers, resulting in construction of the relay-based 
Model I Complex Calculator in 1939. That same year in Germany, engineer Konrad Zuse built his Z2 computer, also 
using telephone company relays.</p>
		<h2>Hewlett-Packard is founded</h2>

		<p>David Packard and Bill Hewlett found their company in a Palo Alto, California garage. Their first product, the HP 
200A Audio Oscillator, rapidly became a popular piece of test equipment for engineers. Walt Disney Pictures ordered 
eight of the 200B model to test recording equipment and speaker systems for the 12 specially equipped theatres that 
showed the movie “Fantasia” in 1940.</p>
